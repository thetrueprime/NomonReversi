# NomonReversi
A series of programs for delivering nomons to applications

Python
  This is an overlay on the desktop which uses tkinter and LDTP. Assuming LDTP supports it, this feature should work with it
C
  This uses the GTK interface to create a non-working game of reversi but more importantly a graph of different types distributions depending on your settings
Javascript
  This is a website that interfaces with text files to play multiple games of reversi using the nomons as the selection tools. It also learns using a normal distribution.
